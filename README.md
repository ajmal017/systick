# systick

Systick is a stock screener being created in Python 3.6. It selects stocks based on technical indicators provided by the user and then displays a dashboard containing historical performance data for each stock. The dashboard functionality has been implemented using data from Pandas dataframes generated by the yfinance API. The data is plotted using Plot.ly and Cufflinks.

The current implementation contains candlestick charts and the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator.
